                                    <h2>Manhattan's Perpendicular Grid Plan Streets and Avenues</h2>
                                    The Manhattan Island we know today was pre-destined to become as it is. Beginning with Dutch-colonial landfill projects moving interior land to the shoreline, and then, in as ambitious a manner, with British policies and similar goals to increase commerce. These humongous fill-ins added to-and eliminated the irregular-East River and Hudson (North) River waterfronts, expanding them north continuously.

                                    By 1889, Manhattan's south-and-north and east-to-west Street and Avenue design was complete, its mass transportation open, and a 1,441,000 population lived and worked as well as moved for a nickel between New York Harbor and Spuyten Duyvil, as the northernmost creek.

                                    Three crucial elements elevated the island capable to be a world-class metropolis. Only a small fraction were natural:
                                    1) Ice-free water borders-the harbor, river, creek, and estuary-to reach for.
                                    2) A rock-solid foundation to build upon-initially, with abundant timber forests.
                                    3) New York City commissioners' Plan of 1811 formally, the Commissioners' Map and Survey of Manhattan Island.

                                    Arguably the third factor was the important component added on. The design became a blueprint to pursue as perpendicular arties was. Actualizing its implementation unrelentingly, was fodder to fuel a 77-year unbridled growth span (although with savage bust cycles, too).

                                    This 1811 urban plan changed much for better, and some for the worse too. There was much the commissioners could not possibly foresee. For example-continuous surging, upward-mobile, immigrant waves; innovations, for instance, electricity requiring underground wiring; a steam-engine, two-paddle clipper; the Erie Barge Canal, creating more and more demand for Hudson River docks and warehouses; and a mass transportation system, above and below ground.

                                    Moreover, the 1811 plan proved to be flexible. Enough so, to allow the unique American Dream of Fifth Avenue, the Avenue, which accommodated the pronouncement-“I've arrived”. From its start at Washington Square-to eradicate a public-health-related, mosquito-ridden Minetta Creek, by a city council edict-this central roadway would connect Downtown Manhattan with the Midtown old Middle Road, near to the Harlem Common in the East 90s.

                                    Fifth Avenue as a concept immediately captured the imagination of the city's elite. Its aristocratic appeal was an absolute-set in stone. Furthermore social awareness and a complementary, progressive, urbane Central Park concept reinforced the progressive movement's cornerstone: build “livable,” mid-island residential neighborhoods.

                                    This, as well as generous, civic-minded land grants or city council purchases corrected a blatant commissioners' Plan of 1811 failure: lacking expansive common spaces throughout the island. Given a 13.4 mile length and 2.3 miles widest span, it is easy with hindsight to appreciate the advantage more open space, and additional north-and-south Avenues as well as decreased crosstown streets, with supplemental wider east-to-west streets, would be.

                                    Yet in 1811, extensive north-and-south traffic was not the case, the demand then was river to river. This practical, but rigid perpendicular “grid plan” accommodated the initial surveying and dividing a rugged terrain into uniform, rectangular, development blocks-north of the initial settlement.

                                    Additionally, the design-begrudgingly, at times-resulted in the expansion of Broadway. By increasing the major Native people's trail to join the amalgamated northern Broad Way, and then incorporating the mid-island, Bloomingdale Road as well as seven miles north, connecting Upper Manhattan's Kingsbridge Road, which completed a continuous, land route from Lower Manhattan to the Albany Post Road.

                                    Remarkable remains that the city advanced any plan at all in 1811.  Or, that the  commissioners selected to read the future well enough to conceive a rigid grid; one to accommodate sidewalks and curbs; motorcars and mass transit; the elevator, making a skyscraper possible; as modestly averring to mandated a city limit, as West 155th Street, that 'would contain 400,000 souls.'

                                    For a 60,000-citizen city to have projected for itself even a 400,000 future-and so far north-are extraordinary enough instances for a conscious vision. Also, the case is made for the plan to end where precipitous cliffs seemed impenetrable to level to the necessary grade, given the engineering know-how at the time.

                                    Who knew? The right approximation was 1,500,000 citizens residing in Manhattan merely 80 years hence, as the 1890 census attests.

                                    <h4>The Lay of the Land</h4>
                                    Due to established street patterns and a concentrated, population density in 1811, Lower Manhattan as well as northeast and northwest Downtown (Canal to 14th Street)spreading east from the Bowery, and then again west to Sixth Avenue, went undisturbed by the upcoming grid design.

                                    These vast land tracts were owned by Dutch scions, and the neighborhoods they encompass, are: the Rutgers and Rhinelander clans, Greater Chinatown; James and Oliver De Lancey, Peter and Nicholas Stuyvesant, the Lower East Side; Nicholas and Samuel Bayard, Little Italy, LoLita, SoHo and NoHo; Lady Sarah (nee de Lancey) and Sir Peter Warren, the West Village, including Abington Square, at one-time, Lady Warren's gardens.

                                    Although the south-to-north Avenues have been widen-several times, for the most part-these initial, easterly, family-owned street designs and westerly, haphazard laid out farm lanes, overall, were transformed into roadways, retained their name designations as well as their integrity-from origination to wending ways to unexpected ending points.

                                    <h4>East-to-west Streets</h4>
                                    The island's regularly spaced Streets are set at a right angle to equally rigid, uniform north-to-south Avenues. An even number address is on the south side. The nearest corresponding odd number runs parallel and opposite on the north side.

                                    Between Eighth and 200th Street, each east-to-west roadway runs continuously from river to river. At the Hudson and East River-which becomes the Harlem River, above East 104th Street-the streets dead-end at both north-and-south riverside highways.

                                    As well, above East 142nd Street, where the island narrows sufficiently, there is no differentiation between the east and west side, on West streets exist. What's more, the list of exceptions includes the public open spaces. In Lower Manhattan, New York City Hall Park; Downtown's Thompkins Square, Union Square, Stuyvesant Square, and Grammercy Park;  Upper East and West side's Central Park; as well as Uptown's Morningside and St. Nicholas Park.

                                    On the north side, uptown, the street addresses are consecutive odd numbers, and even numbers are on the north side or downtown side. Above Eighth Street the address numbering starts at Fifth Avenue, with No. One or No. Two East or West, and increase two digits every 25 feet (a standard city lot width), until reaching the last structure. The greatest street address is 950 East 14th, and 660 West 114th Streets-coinciding with Manhattan's widest points.

                                    Additionally, above East 142nd Street, where the island narrows sufficiently, with no differentiation between the east and west sides, there are West streets only. What's more, the list of exceptions includes the mid-island, public open spaces. For instance, Lower Manhattan's
                                    New York City Hall Park, Downtown's Thompkin or Union Square Park, Midtown's Central Park, or Uptown's Morningside or St. Nicholas Park.
                                    All central island street addresses comprise odd numbers on the north side, and even numbers to the south or downtown side. Above Eighth Street the numbering starts at Fifth Avenue, with No. One and No. Two East or West, progressively increasing by two digits every 25 feet until reaching the last structures: 950 (at East 14th) and 660 (on West 114th) Streets-Manhattan's widest points.
                                    Furthermore, the crosstown roadways consistent width (60 feet) are broken by a wider (100 feet), two-way traffic, thoroughfare, although somewhat randomly placed. These wider accesses, from south to north, are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Lower Manhattan-Chambers and Worth Streets, both moving westerly, and Canal Street, which is two-way traffic flow;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Downtown-Delancey and Grand (both easterly from the Bowery), Houston (westerly traffic flow west of Sixth Avenue), 14th and 23rd Streets;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>

                                        <li>
                                            Upper East and West Sides-72nd, 79th, 86th, and 96th Streets;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>

                                            Upper Manhattan-West 165th and 181st Streets. Between West 194th and 220th Streets, both the Streets and Avenues are named. In addition, the terrain is too hilly for a straight, wide, east-to-west Street. In Inwood Hill and Fort George Hill cliffs the grid is set at an oblique angle to the established southern grid plan.

                                    <h4>The South-to-north Avenue Address Locators</h4>
                                    To begin, there are far more consistent aspects to Manhattan's 140 to 150 feet wide thoroughfares, and the few quirks are consequential. Every exception affects the consistent street numbering, referred to as Lot and Block numbers.  In every instance an even number address is on that Avenue' west side. An odd number runs parallel and approximately opposite the east side.

                                    Regarding the address and nearby crosstown streets, they are: Avenues A-D, Lexington and Madison Avenues are closer to 80 feet apart rather than 120 feet wide. The block lengths are unequal as well.  The distances vary, in feet, as:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            425, from Third to Lexington to Park (Fourth), as well as to Madison Avenue;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            615 to 650, from Avenue D to Third Avenue;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            920 feet, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            800, from Sixth to Twelfth Avenue.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    These north-to-south arteries were not conceived to move the bulk of traffic as they do today, the traffic flow emphasis was river to river. Therefore, they have been widened considerably, with the changing demands.

                                    Even when a name-change occurs, which they often do, the traffic direction is continuous, and rarely vary. Being an island, an Avenue may deviate when approaching one of four tunnels or the fourteen bridge's ingress and egress ramps, or at the turnaround plazas. Initially, each south-and-north roadway was two-way; though several remain.

                                    However, they are either at the extreme east or west, such as Sutton Place South to Sutton Place, which becomes York Avenue above East 60th Street; East End Avenue running between East 79th and 90th Streets; Broadway, above West 60th Street, West End Avenue between West 44th and 59th Streets, as Eleventh Avenue, and to West 108th Street; Riverside Drive, starting on West 72nd to West 125th Streets, and irregularly throughout Harlem and Upper Manhattan.

                                    The single mid-island exception is Fourth Avenue, which accommodates both directions, as Park Avenue South, between East 14th and 33rd Street, and then as Park Avenue to East 97th Street.

                                    The north bound traffic flow is on First, Third, Madison, Sixth, Eighth and Tenth Avenues.     On the other hand, south-bound vehicles use Second, Lexington, Fifth, Seventh and Ninth Avenues as well as the above-mentioned two-way Avenues.

                                    Granted, names such as First or Twelfth Avenue and every number between, are hardly more imaginative than the East or West Street number designations. What is a benefit is every address begins at its northernmost point, with No. One and opposite No. Two. As well as consistently increasing by two digits every 25 feet, as the roadway proceeds north.

                                    Each even number is on the east side, the coinciding odd number always run along the west block front. However, since the Avenues begin at different points, working from a south-to-north Avenue to another and then the next, the numerical address do not follow uniformly. Therefore, pinpointing an exact address to its nearest cross streets is not exact science.

                                    For 200-odd years, the calculation was determined using a two-step formula, which requires employing all available fingers or toes, too. What's more, with the island's undulating shoreline-by broadening unevenly or narrowing sharply, even though having been somewhat mitigated by landfill projects. Naturally, unexpected exceptions crop up at the extremes, often compensating for truncated portions, and each involves a third dimension, along with additional unused digitals.

                                    The very peskiest Avenue exceptions occur wherever Streets have given names, without given consecutive number designations. Therefore, in addition to Lower Manhattan, each neighborhood's exact boundary, between West Canal and Houston Street, and then to West 14th Street, is irregular.

                                    There are three additional East Side Avenues in Lower Manhattan, and they are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Lafayette Street, which begins at Centre Street and moves through to East Eighth Street. Then, between East 8th and 14th Streets it is Fourth Avenue, and becomes Park Avenue South to East 32nd Street, and then Park Avenue to 135th Street.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Running parallel as well as beginning at Chambers Street is Center Street. This wide road narrows for two blocks as Cleveland Place, and then merges into Lafayette Street, at Spring Street. Park.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Park Row starts along New York City Hall Park, becomes the Bowery at Chatham Square, and continues after East 8th Street as Third Avenue.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    There are additional East Side Avenues in Downtown, and from east to west, they are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Allen Street starts at Canal Street and becomes First Avenue at Houston Street.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Chrystie Street starts at becomes Second Avenue at Houston Street.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            University Place begins at East 4th and ends at 14th Street, and then reappears at East 23rd Street, as Madison Avenue, continuing to East 138th Street.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    The New York City commissioners' Plan of 1811 accepted that below Houston Street would be impractical to convert to a true grid; they wisely set their targets beyond. Without complex leases to contend with, or established housing already on preliminary laid out lanes, the perpendicular design was rigorous implemented across the vast northern, hilly and swampy wastelands. The design ignored farm tracts and country estates borders. Unwaveringly, the terrain was leveled and graded. The Street and Avenue pattern, divided as 191 to 201 feet-wide blocks, were further divided into 25 by 100 feet standard city lots.

                                    <h4>Then, There Is Broadway</h4>
                                    Other than the truncated one-mile-long Harlem Lane, spanning West 110th to 124th Streets, the hard-and-fast gird arrangement provided not one northwest-to-southwest thoroughfare. Thus, ignoring Broadway's foremost value, cutting Manhattan's checkerboard quality by crossing nine south-and-north Avenues. Proof of its magnetic quality is that throughout Midtown, lacking a similar beneficial channel, the East Side development lagged behind the West Side, consistently.

                                    Broadway runs the island's full length, from New York Harbor to the northernmost point, Spuyten Duvil Creek, at West 220th Street. Manhattan's narrow southernmost point throughout Lower Manhattan, the East and West Side designations are unnecessary. At Canal and to Eighth Street, the artery divides the Downtown's East Side from West Side. Broadway is then on the East Side until 23rd Street. At the Fourth Avenue crossing, the roadway disappears to accommodate Union Square's unique traffic divergence. When re-emerging north of East 17th Street, the roadbed assumes a decidedly southeast to northwest trajectory. After East 23rd Street, and for the subsequent five miles north, Broadway remains the principal West Side thoroughfare.

                                    At West 59th Street and continuing north to West 168th Street, Broadway widens from four to six lanes, with a planted mall to West 168th Street. At West 78th Street, and north to West 168th Street, Broadway remains on a due north trajectory east of Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues, which are West End Avenue and Riverside Drive. Reaching Upper Manhattan Broadway continues due north, and from West 191st to 201st Street, the roadway is the one north-and-soth Avenue to traverse the Inwood and Fort George Hill sheer cliffs, at the base.

                                    Around the third wider, crosstown Streets, where Broadway also intersects a West Side Avenue, the major plaza formed, include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Fifth Avenue, 23rd to 25th Streets, is Madison Square Park.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Sixth Avenue, West 32nd to 35th Streets, are Greeley and Herald Squares.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Seventh Avenue, West 42nd to 47th Streets, is Times Square.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Eighth Avenue, West 58th to 60th Streets and abutting Central Park, is Columbus Circle.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Ninth (Columbus) Avenue, West 63rd to 66th Streets, becomes Lincoln Square.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Tenth (Amsterdam) Avenue, West 70th to 74th Streets are Sherman Square and Verdi Park;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Eleventh (West End) Avenue, West 106th to 108th Streets, is Straus Park.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Broadway also intersects the farthest westerly Uptown diagonal Avenues, as:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Hamilton Place, West 136th to 138th Streets, is Montifore Park.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            St. Nicholas Avenue, West 167th to 170th Streets, is Mitchel Square Park.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    As Broadway straightens to move due north, in Uptown, St. Nicholas Avenue begins on a sharp northwest trajectory at West 110th Street and Sixth Avenue, and continues through West 135th Street and Eighth Avenue. Thereafter, St. Nicholas Avenues adjusts to a north-northwest curve to West 169th Street. In Upper Manhattan, the roadway moves due north until West 193rd Street.

                                    The five residential enclaves are spread throughout between the Hudson to East Rivers. From meager beginnings, this outpost evolved as a worldwide port and became the Municipal

                                    Lower Manhattan is encased by highways, and can be accessed by the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges as well as the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and Holland Tunnel, to New Jersey. Three wider east-to-west thoroughfares are in the northern sector, as Chambers, Worth and Canal Streets.

                                    Each named Street's address begins at the extreme east or Northeast, and the designation increases consecutively until reaching the western terminus building. The north side consists of even numbers exclusively; the north side is the odd numbers.

                                    The designations, whether Street, Place, Lane, Slip, or Alley, in alphabetical order, are:

                                    From Canal Street, the northernmost border is 23rd Street. This entire part of town extends from the East to Hudson River. From Love Lane, roughly 23rd Street, all the Native Manhattanite trails and paths began. They developed as the routes north.

                                    Fifth Avenue ends at Seventh Street in favor of Washington Square, so to Canal Street, Broadway separates the East Side from the West Side. Named Streets are concentrated south of (East) Houston and (West) 12th Streets. Like Lower Manhattan address numbering starts in the east and continues west, with consecutive, even address on each Street's south side, and with odd numbers running opposite.

                                    Throughout Downtown East similar, planned housing communities form a continuous ribbon along the East River block to First Avenue. The easterly accesses, as an Avenue 'A' through Avenue 'D', were included between Houston to East 14th Street, where the island's easterly shoreline widens. However, these Avenues disappear completely before East 23rd Street. The easterly Downtown Manhattan neighborhood boundaries, from south to north and east to west, are:

The revival brought distinct enclaves as Greater Chinatown, as along Canal Street and East Broadway, running between the East River to the Bowery;  the Lower East Side, as Delancey to Houston Street, spanning Clinton Street to the Bowery; Little Italy and NoLita, as the southwestern quarter, spreading from the Bowery to Broadway, and Canal to East Houston Street.

                                    Not one double-wide, east-to-west Street was inserted between Canal and Houston Streets.  At the east, the narrow road beds, often no wider than a lane, make up the uber-revived Lower East Side as a neighborhood. It is now encased between Delancey, Rivington, Stanton, and Houston Streets, and spans Bowery to Clinton Street, which is approximately at Avenue B.

                                    To the center, between the Bowery and Broadway, still in Downtown East, where Broadway separates east from west, is a second neighborhood, Little Italy and NoLita.

                                    Along East Broadway, within the farthest southeasterly quarter is Greater Chinatown. The existing east-to-west roadways, are:

                                    <h4>East Houston to 14th Street Address Locator</h4>
                                    From this intersection, known as North Street, the New York City commissioners' Plan of 1811 was implemented…without question…throughout the East and Harlem River's length.

                                    Therefore, the Avenue and Street Address Locators continue uniformly through each neighborhood: Downtown East, Midtown East, Upper East Side, and Uptown, where each Avenue terminates at the Harlem River.

                                    <h4>The East-to-west Street Address Locators </h4>
                                    The exceptions, between East First and Eighth Streets, in central East Village and NoHo, include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>On East First through Fourth Streets, the address numbering starts at the Bowery.</li>
                                        <li>On East Fifth through Seventh Streets-as Bleecker, Bond, and Great Jones Streets respectively-address numbering begins at Broadway;</li>
                                        <li>On East Eighth Street, No. One begins at Fifth Avenue, moving east, and increases by 2 digits at each standard 25-foot city lot.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Beginning at Fifth Avenue, with No. one, the highest numbers are nearest the Hudson River, and from east to west, and they are:

                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>The South-to-north Avenue Address Locators</h4>
                                    Alphabet City is the East Village easterly enclave. It comprises East First to 13th Streets, surrounds Tompkins Square Park, encompassing Avenue 'A' to 'B' and East Seventh to Tenth Streets, and then to the East River.

                                    <h3>West Canal to Houston Street</h3>
                                    In 1811, the vast Bayard East and West Farms with a combined sized figured in miles, not acres, ran from Canal to West Third Street, and spread west from the Bowery along 15 blocks to Sixth Avenue. Virtually Little Italy, now Lolita, and SoHo into southern Greenwich Village.
                                    Throughout the 1760s, Nicholas Bayard II laid out streets in his southeast tracts, comprising Water, now Canal, to Hester and Grand Streets. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 included these initial streets, and continued the grid north through the estate to Houston Street and Sixth Avenue.

                                    <h4>East-to-west Streets</h4>
                                    Not one wider street was inserted other than Canal and Houston Streets. The four narrow roadways, often no wider than a lane, are Grand, Broome, Spring and Prince Streets.

                                    <h4>North-to-south Avenues</h4>
                                    With 18 roadways, the five wider, east-to-west thoroughfares, from east to west, are:
                                    Broadway;

                                    The East Side consists of six avenues, First to Fifth Avenue. There are exceptions as the island's East Side widens, between Canal and 14th Streets, where four additional avenues are Avenue A through Avenue D.
                                    These letter avenues disappear between 14th Street and 49th Streets, when Avenue A reappears: First as the dead-end Beekman Place enclave, then again on 53rd Street as Sutton Place South and Sutton Place, and above 59th to 94th Street as York Avenue.
                                    Avenue B reappears, briefly, as East End Avenue, which runs for eleven blocks along the East River, between 79th and 90th Streets. It disappears as the island narrows considerably at 91st Street.
                                    In addition, during the mid-nineteenth century, Madison and Lexington Avenues were inserted above 23rd Street between Fifth and Park and Park and Third Avenues, respectively.  Both avenues disappear near 135th Street.
                                    For example, Fifth Avenue, the dividing point for the East and West Sides, begins at 8th Street, although, as West Broadway, it starts at the northern edge of colonial New York. West Broadway continues to Houston Street, then as Lafayette Place to 4th Street, where at Washington Square North, it is lower Fifth Avenue, and only above 23rd Street, is Fifth Avenue.
                                    These additional East Side avenues include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>University Place begins at 4th Street and ends at 14th Street, and then reappears at 23rd Street, as Madison Avenue up to 138th Street DE</li>
                                        <li>Centre Street begins at Chambers Street, between 8th and 14th Streets becomes Fourth Avenue, is Park Avenue South to 32nd Street, and then Park Avenue to 135th Street. LM</li>
                                        <li>Park Row becomes the Bowery at Canal Street, and continues after 8th Street as Third Avenue LM</li>
                                        <li>Chrystie Street becomes Second Avenue at Houston Street DE</li>

                                    This renowned slice of Manhattan is a two-square-mile square. The four sides being: Fifth Avenue to the east, the Hudson River on the west, West 23rd in the south, and West 59th Street as the northerly borderline. Moreover, each ten-block marker is a differentiation-as the West Twenties, Thirties, Forties, and Fifties. Moreover, it comprises four sectors, as: southern, central, easterly, dead center, and northerly.
                                    Beginning at East 59th Street, with the southernmost point as East 23rd Street, this mid-island part of town runs from Fifth Avenue to the East River all the way through.
                                    For better than 100 years, there was one broad and continuous slum swathe, between Ninth and Eleventh Avenues. Nowadays, the residential pockets form enclaves, nestled unexpectedly, cropping up amid commercial office-building skyscrapers-especially near to Central Park and Seventh Avenue, which once was touted as Avenue of the Future.
                                    from Fifth Avenue west to the Hudson River, West 14th to Central Park South, 59th Street, the numbering is:

                                    <h4>The East-to-west Street Address Locators</h4>
                                    Throughout Upper East Side the Street's north side is an even number. Starting at Fifth Avenue as No. Two, and then continuing consecutively to the highest address number at the farthest east.  Likewise, each street's north side, an odd number, begins with No. One, extending to the East River. Continuing consecutively, the Street address locators run in units from Avenue to Avenue, as:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Nos.  1 to 40 East, from Fifth to Madison Avenue</li>
                                        <li>Nos.  50 to 99 East, from Madison to Park Avenue</li>

                                    The Upper East Side numbering consistently carries through from where Midtown East (which continued from Downtown East.) Therefore, the numbers graduate from south to north. The easternmost Upper East Side Avenues, continuations of Avenues 'B' and 'A', re-emerge as the island expands. The Avenues, from east to west, they are:

                                    Prior to Central Park opening in 1858, the sector beyond the Broadway's intercession at Central Park South and Eighth Avenue (the Bloomingdale Road at West 59th Street and the Great Circle), and then spreading from Columbus Circle to the Hudson River through West 125th Street, was one vicinity. It was named after Bloomingdale Hill, at West 94th Street and Ninth (Columbus) Avenue.

                                    In the northwest corner the Bloomingdale village ended at a bluff above the Harlem Plain. Besides the entirely hilly and rocky terrain, there were intermittent streams, creeks, and marshes. The dominant feature, though, was abundant, colossal sold rock protrusions. This was where the bastion in Manhattan for Patroon country seats. Many lasting through to the 1870s.

                                    The separate, north-and-south corridors, running through the Upper West Side are defined, as:

                                        <li>Riverside-West End spans West 72nd and then continues north to 107th Street, and from Broadway to Riverside Park.</li>
                                        <li>Schuyler Corridor spans West 72nd to 96th Streets, and encases west of Columbus Avenue to East of Broadway.</li>
                                        <li>Manhattan Valley stretches from West 94th to 110th Streets, and spreading between Central Park West and Broadway.</li>
                                        <li>Morningside Heights, historically-speaking is within the Bloomingdale Village, spanning the West Nineties to West 125th Street, and running from Broadway to Riverside Drive.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    The simple Upper West Side Street address numbering, between West 59th and 109th Streets, accommodating Central Park, is:
